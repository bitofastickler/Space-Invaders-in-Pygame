# Space-Invaders-in-Pygame
Code with minor alterations based on Attreya Bhatt's YouTube tutorial. See his repository at https://github.com/attreyabhatt/Space-Invaders-Pygame
Original YouTube tutorial here: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FfWpgLFMI7w
All audio files were sourced at https://freesound.org/
All art except for the laser was sourced at https://www.freepik.com/free-photos-vectors/game-background
The laser art was my own work created in Inkscape

Attreya's version includes different art, and different ratios for his characters.
This was all originally written in PyCharm using Pygame.
